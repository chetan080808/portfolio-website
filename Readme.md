## 🌐 Deployment

### Why Vercel?

Chose Vercel as the hosting platform due to:

✅ **Zero Cost** - Free tier perfect for personal portfolios  
✅ **Automatic Deployments** - Push to GitHub equals instant deployment  
✅ **Global CDN** - Lightning-fast content delivery worldwide  
✅ **SSL Certificate** - Free HTTPS out of the box  
✅ **Zero Configuration** - Works with React automatically  
✅ **Serverless** - Scales automatically without management  
✅ **Custom Domains** - Free subdomain plus custom domain support  

### Deployment Process

1. Push code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to production"
git push origin main

text

2. Vercel auto-deploys - Detects changes in main branch, runs build process, deploys to global CDN, provides instant preview URL

3. Live in 2-3 minutes

### Alternative Platforms Considered

**Netlify** - Free but Vercel has better React optimization

**GitHub Pages** - Free but requires manual builds, no serverless

**AWS S3 + CloudFront** - Costs $5-10 per month, more configuration needed

**Heroku** - Free tier ending, limited free options

**Firebase Hosting** - Free but Vercel simpler for React apps

**Winner: Vercel** - Best balance of performance, features, and zero cost
